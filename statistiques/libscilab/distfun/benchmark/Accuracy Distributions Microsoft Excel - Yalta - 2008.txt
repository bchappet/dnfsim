Description				
In this Excel file, we test the numerical accuracy of Excel's distribution functions. 
The distribution under test are compared to values computed with the ELV program by Knusel. 
For given parameters, we compute the number of significant digits by evaluating the log 
of the relative error (LRE). 
For IEEE754 2008 double precision computations (i.e. binary 64 floating point numbers), 
the highest possible value of LRE is 17.
But ELV values are reported with 6 significant digits only. 
In other words, the maximum possible LRE value in the file is approximately 6.
When the LRE is zero, this means that there is no significant digit. 			

In order to update all cells in the Excel sheet, type 
Control+Alt+Shift+F9.
If we do not do this, the content of the cells is not refreshed.

Notations				
Exact : the value of the paper from Yalta, computed with ELV.				
RE : The relative error				
LRE : The logarithm of the relative error, i.e. the number of accurate digits.
