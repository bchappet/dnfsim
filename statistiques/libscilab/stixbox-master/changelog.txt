changelog of the Stixbox Toolbox

stixbox (not released yet)
    * Updated help pages for betaln.
      Created associated unit tests.
    * Removed betainc. To update your code, please replace 

I = betainc(x,z,w)

with 

I = distfun_betainc(x,z,w)

    * Updated the histo function.
This fixes the following bugs :

http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1442/
histo is poorly implemented

http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1417/
histo can fail

http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/762/
histo does not use my exact number of classes

The "odd" option does not exist anymore.
To update your code, please replace :

histo(data,x,odd,...);

with

histo(data,x,...);

i.e. remove "odd" from the calling sequence.

The "scale" argument is now a boolean. 
To update your code, if the scaling is disabled, 
please replace :

histo(x,n,odd,0)

with 

histo(x,n,%f)

If the scaling is enabled, please replace :

histo(x,n,odd,1)

with 

histo(x,n,%t)

stixbox (2.2)
    * Fixed bug #763: histo could not use the edges I want
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/763/
    * Fixed bug #822: pairs had no example.
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/822/
      Removed the pairs function: it did not work anyway. 
    * Created the plotmatrix function, compatible with Matlab.
      This is a replacement for the removed "pairs" function.
    * Removed function plotdens: it had no help page, no test, 
      and failed.
    * Created ksdensity function, compatible with Matlab.
      This is a replacement for the removed "plotdens" function.
    * For plotsym : clarified help page, implementation, 
      added examples, added unit tests.
    * Created new bubblechart, bubblematrix functions.
    * Created a "Polynomials" section.
      Added examples to polyfit.
      Added examples to polyval.
    * Changed implementation of polyval to better handle 
      ill-conditionned matrices, so that we can have a workaround 
      for bug : http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9196
      We use the linalg module, and the linalg_dgesv function.
    * Fix bug #188: polyfit and polyval are incompatible.
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/188
      Changed order of powers p in the argument of polyfit, 
      in order to 
       * make the call consistent with polyeval, 
       * make the function compatible with Matlab.
      This breaks the backward compatibility. 
      To update your code, please replace :
      
p = polyfit(x,y,n)

with 

p = polyfit(x,y,n)
p=p($:-1:1)

    * Fixed computation of confidence bound in polyval. 
      Added an example and a unit test of confidence interval.
    * polyfit : computed Vandermonde matrix from makematrix.
    * cov : changed implementation and help page. 
      Added examples in the help page.
      Added a unit test.
      cov is now compatible with Matlab.
    * Created new corrcoef function.
      corrcoef is compatible with Matlab.
    * Improved the stairs function to improve compatibility 
      with Matlab.
      stairs can plot several stairstep graphs in one statement.
      The stairs(y) calling sequence is available.
      Added a unit test.
      Added several examples in the help page.
    * Added the regres function, which performs multiple linear 
      regression. 
      This function is compatible with Matlab. 
      This function is similar to the "lm" function in R.
      The regres function was first available in the scidoe module. 
      The "regres" function name was chosen because "regress" 
      already exists in Scilab, but Scilab's "regress" is not Matlab-compatible, 
      and has much less features.
    * Added the regresprint function, which prints the 
      analysis of variance table.
      This function is similar to the "anova" function in R.
    * Removed the linreg function. 
      This was done for the following reasons:
      * linreg did not work.
      * linreg was not compatible with Matlab.
      * linreg had no examples in the help page.
      * linreg had poorly documented input arguments.
      * linreg had no unit tests.
      * linreg did both graphics and computations, which was  
        a poor design choice.
      * linreg was univariate, while regress is multivariate.
    To update your legacy code, please replace:

linreg(Y,X)

with

B = scidoe_regress(Y,[ones(X),X]);
plot(X,B(1)*ones(X)+B(2)*X,"r-")

      But this is unlikely, since linreg did not work (at least, 
      the demo did not).
    * Updated the help page of identify.
      Added examples. 
      Added description of input arguments.
      Fixed a bug : the plotsymbol input argument was ignored.
    * histo : 
      Fixed a bug in the example where edges are set.
      Fixed a bug in the code where edges are set.
    * ciboot : 
      Updated the help page : added examples, parameters description.
      Updated the implementation to use distfun.
    * test1b : fixed implementation by replacing the 
      std function with Scilab's stdev.
    * Created a next "Resampling Techniques" section with:
      * ciboot
      * covboot
      * covjack
      * rboot
      * stdboot
      * stdjack
      Updated most help pages, with calling sequence, 
      parameter description, description and examples.
    * Fixed bug #1084: 
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1084/
      A new "Regression" help section was created.
    * Fixed a bug in covboot:
      The output values were wrong for "mean","median", since 
      Matlab returns columnwise results while Scilab 
      returns a scalar.
      The estimate in this case was completely wrong. 
      For "std", the function did not work, as this function 
      does not exist in Scilab.
    * Fixed bug #1083:
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1083/
      The Resampling Technique functions had no unit tests.
    * Fixed bug #1070
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1070/
      The Resampling Technique functions do not check input args.
    * Fixed bug #1069:
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1069/
      The Resampling Technique functions do not manage 
      extra-arguments properly.
    * Fixed bug #1071
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1071/
      rboot had no example
    * Fixed the test1b function : the confidence interval for the 
      standard deviation was wrong. 
      This is because the stdev function in Scilab returns a scalar, 
      while Matlab's std returns a row vector.
    * Added help page and unit test for test1b.
    * Added help page and unit test for test1n.
      Fixed implementation : pt, qt and qchisq did not 
      exist anymore.
      Fixed bug #1086: Execution of stixbox 2.1-1 test1n function failed.
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1086/#ic2883
    * Added help page and unit test for test2n.
      Fixed implementation : var, pt, qt and qchisq did not 
      exist anymore.
    * Added help page and unit test for test1r.
    * Added help page and unit test for test2r.

stixbox (2.1)
    * Fixed bug #1025 : qqplot had no example
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1025/
      Improved the help page of qqplot:
      added several examples.
    * Fixed bug #1024: The example in histo does not work.
      http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/stixbox/issues/1024/
    * Removed bincoef (obsolete).
To update your code, please replace

bincoef(n,N)

with 

specfun_nchoosek(N,n)

    * Removed gammainc (obsolete).
To update your code, please replace

y=gammainc(x,a)

with 

y=distfun_gammainc(x,a)

stixbox (2.0)
    * Moved rboot to Misc help section
    * Removed std function: use Scilab's stdev instead.
To update your code, please use the following rules.
If A is a row or column vector, then replace std(A) with stdev(A).
If A is a matrix, then replace std(A) with stdev(A,"r") :

-->A=[1,2,10;7,7.1,7.01]
 A  =
    1.    2.     10.   
    7.    7.1    7.01  
-->std(A)
 ans  =
    4.2426407    3.6062446    2.1142493  
-->stdev(A,"r")
 ans  =
    4.2426407    3.6062446    2.1142493  
    * Removed unnecessary requirement on Scilab 5.4.
    * Removed bincoef function: use specfun_nchoosek instead.
To update your code, please install the specfun module:

atomsInstall("specfun")

and replace 

k=bincoef(n,N) 

with 

k=specfun_nchoosek(N,n)

Notice that N and n are exchanged.
    * Updated the unit tests to use assert functions.
    * Removed the following functions:

Probability Distribution Functions: 
dbeta, dbinom, dchisq, df, dgamma, dhypg, dnorm, dt
Probability Cumulative Distribution Functions
pbeta, pbinom, pchisq, pf, pgamma, phypg, pnorm, pt
Inverse Cumulative Distribution Functions
qbeta, qbinom, qchisq, qf, qgamma, qhypg, qnorm, qt
Random Numbers
rbeta, rbinom, rchisq, rf, rgamma, rgeom, rhypg, rnorm, rpoiss, rt
Reject Methods
rjbinom, rjgamma, rjpoiss

      Users should use the distfun module for Scilab.
      To install it, type:

atomsInstall("distfun")

      This has been decided for the following reasons :
      * Stixbox's distribution have known bugs, but no 
        known maintainer to fix them.
      * distfun is compatible with Matlab.
      * distfun has more tests.
      * distfun has more help pages and examples.
      * distfun has more consistent functions.
      * distfun's distributions are vectorized (and fast).
    * The previous change automatically fixes the following bugs.
