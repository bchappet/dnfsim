Description: The goal of this toolbox is to provide accurate distribution functions. 
 The provided functions are designed to be compatible with Matlab.
 
 The goals of this toolbox are the following.
  * All functions are tested with tables (actually, csv datasets).
    The tests includes accuracy tests, so that the accuracy 
    should by from 13 to 15 significant digits in most cases.
  * For each distribution, we have 
    * the probability distribution function (PDF)
    * the cumulated distribution function (CDF)
    * the inverse CDF
    * the random number generator
    * the statistics (mean and variance)
  * The CDF provides the upper and the lower tail of the 
    distribution, for accuracy reasons. 
  * The uniform random numbers are of high quality.
    The default is to use the Mersenne-Twister generator.   
  * Each function has a consistent help page.
    This removes confusions in the meaning 
    of the parameters and clarifies the differences 
    with other computing languages (e.g. R).
    
 The design is similar to Matlab's distribution functions. 
 A significant difference with Matlab's function is that both 
 the upper and lower tails are available in "distfun", while 
 Matlab only provides the lower tail. 
 Hence, "distfun" should provide a better accuracy when 
 probabilities close to 1 are computed (e.g. p=0.9999). 
 
 There are many interesting, positive, differences with Scilab, Stixbox, or other
 tools. For a full set of motivations, please read :
